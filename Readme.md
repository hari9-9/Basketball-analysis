# BasketBall Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, we take a dataset consisting of the Shot logs of NBA players and Analyze them. 
The project revolves around two of my favorite players Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson 
I have divided this project into two parts


### Part 1
In this section, we analyze just the two players Steph and Klay.
This section aims to prove How similar their playing Style is

We will be looking at how each of them performs With respect to certain parameters Such as:
    -Time remaining on the Shot clock
    -Early Possession Scoring
    -Late Possession Scoring
    -Scoring based on how much time they have spent with the ball in that specific game
    -Scoring based on number of Dribbles Taken
    -Scoring early in the game
    -Scoring based on Closest defender distance

After which we  can conclude that they have a Similar Style of playing 

We then apply Logistic regression to the Data to predict if they will score based on the parameters mentioned above

### Part 2(TODO)

Now that we have concluded how Curry and Klay have a similar Skillset in this section we compare them with the rest of the NBA to Show how and why These two are such a Unique Talent in the sport of Basketball.
